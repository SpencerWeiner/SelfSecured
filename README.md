SelfSecured: An All-In-One Personal Safety App
===========

###Background
The basic goal of a personal safety app is to provide a user with, predictably, a feeling of personal safety.  Indeed, a plethora of applications exist that already provide fragments of this important serviceâ€”timer apps, panic button apps, guardian alert apps, and so on.  Most often these apps alert authorities, usually emergency services, police, or, for example, campus security.

To what extent, however, does this further the goal of giving someone a sense of confidence in themselves?  What happens when the standard authorities are not necessarily those whom the user wishes to alert of danger?

SelfSecured aims to give users the ability to feel safe and confident in themselves before relying on any external party by collecting features currently fragmented and scattered across categories of applications and placing them in one easy-to-use app, including (but not limited to) timer and panic button functions, audio/video recording, social media integration, and geolocation/geofences.

SelfSecured is an [RCOS](http://rcos.rpi.edu) project.

###Licensing
SelfSecured will be tentatively released under the GPLv3.0 license.

###Technologies Used
SelfSecured will be developed initially as an Android application for phones and possibly tablets, meaning that it will in large part be written in Java.  In addition, the Parse app backend system may be used to collect and store data depending on how features of SelfSecured evolve.

###Goals
* To provide users with a sense of security and self-confidence that comes before a similar sense rooted in any external party.
* To collect features commonly used in different applications and categories of applications (social broadcasting, recording, etc.) and make them easily accessible through a single interface.
* To use device features (e.g. geolocation, multiple cameras) to assist users in feeling safe and collecting helpful evidence.

###Research Required
Some research has already been done, talking to several people (including some victims of past crimes who utilized other applications at the time) about desired features in a personal safety app.  This will continue into development.

From a technical standpoint, research will focus on cultivating Android development skills, integrating it with app backends such as Parse, and intelligently utilizing device sensors.

###Timeline
Weeks 1-5:
* Continue collection of feature ideas
* Design/sketch possible UI ideas
* Create app code framework, begin implementing simpler features

Weeks 6-11:
* Refine existing features
* Research/implement more advanced app features
* Evaluate storage/analysis of personal data
* Collect feedback from potential users

Weeks 12-14:
* Polish application, complete features
* Test & debug application
* Publish & deploy application
